# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [v1.1.0] - 2025-07-06
### Added
* Improved Apple Home compatibility by enabling Matterbridge's `server` mode by default. This exposes each robot vacuum as a standalone Matter node rather than a bridged endpoint. It requires each robot vacuum to be re-paired with the Matter controller. The previous bridged behaviour can be restored by setting `"enableServerRvc": false`. Requires Matterbridge v3.1.1 or later.

## [v1.0.0] - 2025-07-04
### Added
* Support cleaning of specific zones via the Service Area cluster.
### Changed
* Updated dependencies.

## [v0.4.1] - 2025-06-21
### Changed
* Accept `CustomPlay/persistentMapId` and `CustomPlay/zones` capabilities from the API.
* Updated dependencies.

## [v0.4.0] - 2025-05-26
### Changed
* The `blackList` and `whiteList` now use the robot vacuum's serial number instead of its name.
* Revised README and package identifiers.

## [v0.3.1] - 2025-05-20
### Fixed
* Compatibility with Matterbridge version 3.0.3.
### Changed
* Updated dependencies.

## [v0.3.0] - 2025-04-30
### Added
* Implemented `Log Debug as Info` configuration option.
### Changed
* Dropped Node.js 18 support.
* Updated dependencies.

## [v0.2.0] - 2025-04-22
### Fixed
* Wait until endpoints have been initialised before configuring them.
### Changed
* Use manufacturer-defined **OperationalStatus** codes for `ManualSteering` and `FirmwareUpgrade` states (previously they were reported as `Error` states).
* Use manufacturer-defined **OperationalError** code for non-standard errors (previously all unmappable errors were reported as `UnableToCompleteOperation`).
* Improved log output colouring.

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-04-19
* Initial version.
