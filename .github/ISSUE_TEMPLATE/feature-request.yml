        Before creating a new feature request, please search [closed/rejected issues](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-aeg-robot/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to avoid duplicates.

       ðŸš¨ Requests that propose:
        - Disabling or suppressing existing functionality via extra configuration options
        - Using Matter clusters in ways that violate CSA specifications

        ...are unlikely to be accepted.

        **Important notes:**
        - Feature requests must be compatible with the capabilities of both Matter and the Electrolux Group API.
        - Features that fall outside the scope of either are unlikely to be implemented.
        - Detailed, actionable suggestions with technical rationale, are much more likely to be considered.
