        Before creating a new feature request, please search [closed/rejected issues](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-aeg-robot/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to avoid duplicates.

        ðŸš¨ Feature requests that propose any of the following are unlikely to be accepted:
        - Disabling or suppressing existing functionality via additional configuration options
        - Using Matter clusters in ways that violate CSA specifications
        - Implementing Matter clusters that are not supported by Apple Home

      label: Description of Enhancement
      description: |
        Describe the feature or improvement you would like to see. 
        Be specific: What problem does it solve? How would a user experience it differently?

      label: Electrolux Group API
      description: |
        Suggest how this feature could be supported using the [Electrolux Group API](https://developer.electrolux.one/documentation/reference).
    validations:
      required: false

  - type: textarea

    attributes:
      label: Matter Mapping
      description: |
        Suggest which Matter cluster(s) from the [Matter Application Cluster Specification](https://csa-iot.org/developer-resource/specifications-download-request/) might apply.

        Note: Apple Home only supports a subset of Matter clusters. The most accurate (though incomplete) information is available in [this Apple support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102135). It does not yet reflect recent additions such as robot vacuums (added in iOS 18.4).

        If the requested feature maps to a Matter cluster that is unsupported by Apple Home it is unlikely to be implemented, even if technically valid within Matter.

        **Important notes:**
        - Feature requests must be compatible with both the Matter specification and the Electrolux Group API.
        - Requests that fall outside the scope of either, or that are unsupported by Apple Home, are unlikely to be implemented.
        - Detailed, actionable suggestions with clear technical rationale are far more likely to be considered.
